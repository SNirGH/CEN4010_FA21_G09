            <p>
                Ever since I was younger, I would always be fascinated with how the animation, whether 2D or 3D, works.
                I would watch movies and TV shows and try and figure out what could posssibly make these models and drawings
                move and come to life.

            <h4>Drawing</h4>
            <p>
                Along with animation, I do enjoy drawing things for myself. Taking an idea from my head and realizing it by drawing
                it on a blank canvas is something I really love doing. It allows me to create unique characters that I have imagined 
                and be able to see it in real life.

            <h4>Programming</h4>
            <p>
                Programming is a lot like animation and drawing for me: taking an idea and implementing it. In this case, the implementation
                involves writing programs that can become software, games, etc.
